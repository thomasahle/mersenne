\paragraph{$k$-wise hashing without modulus}

A very common algorithm is to define
$h(x) = \sum_{i=0}^k a_i x^i \mod p$
for some prime $p$.

This is efficient if $p$ supports fast modulus.
However now the range of $h$ is $[p]$, which may not be what we are looking for.
Hence it is common to take $h(x)\mod m$ for some $m<p$.
However $m$ is a general number, and can't be expected to support fast modulus.

An alternative is the following:
\begin{align}
   \left\lfloor\frac{h(x)m}{p}\right\rfloor.
\end{align}
This only requires division with $p$, which we have shown can be done fast.

An alternative is to compute $q = \lfloor2^n/p\rfloor$ and take
\begin{align}
\left\lfloor
   \frac{h(x)mq}2^n
\right\rfloor
\end{align}
but that requires using larger words, and has some other drawbacks\todo{Which ones?}
