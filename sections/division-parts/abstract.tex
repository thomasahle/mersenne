\begin{abstract}
   We give a simple algorithm for division and modulo calculation with
   Generalized and Pseudo-Mersenne Primes, that is prime numbers on the form $q-c$.
   Our algorithm is competitive with the state of the art, while implementable in two lines of code.

   This includes important cryptographic primes such as $p_{192}=2^{192} - 2^{64} - 1$.
   For $x < (q/c)^n$ our algorithm times time $n$, and uses no more registers than it takes to store $x$.
