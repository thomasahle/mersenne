\begin{abstract}
The classic way of computing a $k$-universal hash function is to use a random degree-$(k-1)$ polynomial over a prime field $\mathbb Z_p$.
For a fast computation of the polynomial, the prime $p$ is often chosen as a Mersenne prime $p=2^b-1$.

In this paper, we show that there are other nice advantages to using Mersenne primes.
Our view is that the output of the hash function is a $b$-bit integer that is uniformly distributed in $[2^b]$, except that $p$ (the all \texttt1s value) is missing.
Uniform bit strings have many nice properties, such as splitting into substrings, which
%Thinking of the hash values as almost uniform $b$-bit integers
leads to simple efficient code with strong theoretical qualities.
We will demonstrate this with focus on the 4-universal hashing in the classic count-sketch for second moment estimation.

From an algorithmic perspective we provide a new algorithm for division and modulus with Pseudo-Mersenne primes
$p=2^b-c$ for small $c$,
which improves upon a classical algorithm of Crandall, and 
expands the availability and speed of Mersenne based techniques.
